Hello and welcome to the Introduction to Molecular Modeling in Drug Discovery course, part of the Schr√∂dinger online learning platform. In this course, we will discuss how to use molecular modeling in 

    * hit identification, 
    * hit-to-lead ideation, and 
    * compound property and potency optimization

# High-throughput virtual screens 

High-throughput virtual screens have suffered from quality issues, and because of this, the docking score that is output from a virtual screen should in no way be used as a metric to compare with ligand affinities. Recent findings from the Shoichet lab using ultra-large docking libraries suggest that some of the quality issues that have plagued high throughput virtual screening in the past may be partially resolved with the screening of more compounds that cover more of chemical space. This is because it is now possible to dock libraries of compounds with over 100 million ligands in a reasonable amount of time, and thus screen more of chemical space.

# Lead Optimzation
The optimization of primary hits from screening is another area where molecular modeling can be of service. Historically, lead optimization strategies have consisted of building up structure-activity relationships consisting of hundreds of compounds that take several years to synthesize and test the safety, metabolic stability, chemical stability, absorption, and solubility of these leads - all while maintaining favorable efficacy.
